## ML Data Cleaning and Feature Selection

### Overview:
In this project, I conducted data cleaning and feature selection on a dataset for predictive learning. The main tasks included identifying data types, handling missing values, determining the likely distributions of numeric variables, selecting useful independent variables, assessing missing data in independent variables, checking data consistency between training and test sets, examining predictor variable independence, identifying important predictor variables, evaluating predictor variable ranges and distributions, handling outliers, and imputing missing values using multiple methods.

### Key Tasks:
- Data type identification (numeric and categorical)
- Handling missing values
- Assessing likely distributions of numeric variables
- Selecting useful independent variables using three methods
- Identifying independent variables with missing data and determining the amount
- Comparing training and test sets for data consistency
- Evaluating predictor variable independence
- Identifying important predictor variables
- Evaluating predictor variable ranges and distributions
- Handling outliers
- Imputing missing values using three imputation methods
- Evaluating imputation method performance

## Model Interpretability

### Overview:
In this project, I focused on interpreting predictive models by fitting linear and tree-based models and conducting SHAP analysis. The main tasks included interpreting regression coefficients, tree nodes, and SHAP values, and comparing them across different model interpretability methods.

### Key Tasks:
- Fitting linear and tree-based models
- Interpreting regression coefficients and tree nodes
- Conducting SHAP analysis
- Comparing SHAP values with other interpretability methods
